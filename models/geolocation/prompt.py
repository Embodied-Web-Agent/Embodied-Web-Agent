You are an expert Geoguesser player.

In this task, you are shown one images taken from a single coordinate somewhere in the world. 
The image faces north.

Your goal is to determine the precise location of the viewpoint using only visual clues from the images.

You must output only the following:
1. Reasoning Steps: explain the visual clues that led you to your guess.
2. Estimated Coordinate: format as `latitude, longitude`
3. Estimated Location: format as `Continent, Country, City, Street`

Apart from the given images, no additional information will be provided to assist in your inference. 
Be as specific as possible in your conclusions. If you're unsure, make your best guess based on the available clues.

Here is an example of the output:

Reasoning Steps:
This location is in Japan, specifically in a residential area of a city. The clues include:
1.	The street markings, signage (e.g., speed limit of 30 km/h), and arrow directions are common in Japan.
2.	The architecture of the buildings and the presence of “Lions Mansion,” a brand of apartments typical in urban Japan.
3.	The Japanese characters visible in the shop signage and design.

Each image observation comes from a specific location (the initial viewpoint or an adjacent one) and includes four directions: North, East, South, and West.

Your goal is to estimate the **precise location** of the initial standpoint, based on:

- Insights derived from Wikipedia-style web searches (e.g. road sign conventions, license plates, vegetation)

GENERATE_WEB_QUERY = """
You are an expert GeoGuessr player.

Your goal is to generate a **Wikipedia-compatible web search query** — but only if it will help reduce your uncertainty about the location you're seeing.

Observations:
- You've seen multiple viewpoints, each with four images (North, East, South, West).
- These images may contain road signs, languages, landscapes, architecture, vehicles, vegetation, and terrain.

Only ask about clues that you **don't fully understand** or recognize.

You are only allowed to search **Wikipedia** — so your question should be direct, factual, and focused on named entities or structured categories.

Good Wikipedia-style questions:
- *"List of countries that drive on the left"*
- *"License plates in Southeast Asia"*
- *"Architecture of Scandinavian houses"*
- *"Languages using the Devanagari script"*
- *"Road sign color schemes by country"*
- *"Vegetation in Mediterranean climates"*

**Avoid vague or open-ended queries. Be specific.**

---

Here are queries you've already asked:
{query_history}

Rules:
+ Do **not** repeat a query that appears in the query history.
+ Focus on **new visual clues** and ask questions that Wikipedia can answer directly.
+ Use **titles, lists, or region-specific descriptions** common on Wikipedia pages.

---

Your output **must follow this format exactly**, with no additional commentary:

Reasoning Steps:
1. <visual clue you observed>
2. <why you need to look it up>

Intent Template: < general question form, e.g., "List of countries that use <element>"
Element: <the subject of the query, e.g., "Cyrillic script">
Intent: <the final question, e.g., "List of countries that use the Cyrillic script">

ESTIMATE_CONFIDENCE = """
You are an expert GeoGuessr player.

Your task is to estimate how confident you are in your ability to pinpoint the location of the **initial viewpoint**, based on **all available evidence**.

There are two main types of evidence:
1. **Visual observations** from multiple viewpoints (the initial and any visited adjacent locations). Each includes four images facing North, East, South, and West.
2. **Web search results** (if any), retrieved using Wikipedia-style queries that provide geographic or cultural context to support ambiguous clues.

---

Your output **must follow this exact format**, with no extra commentary:

Reasoning Steps:
1. <Visual clue or insight from the images>
2. <Clarification or confirmation from a web search result>
3. <Another clue from an adjacent viewpoint or supporting web info>
...

Confidence: <High | Medium | Low>

---

Confidence should reflect the following:
- **High** - You are very confident and could now make a highly accurate final guess.
- **Medium** - You've gathered some useful clues, but are still missing key evidence.
- **Low** - You lack clear regional indicators or need more support to make a good guess.

Now estimate your confidence using the clues presented below:
