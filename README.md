We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. 
To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation guessing â€” all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence.
